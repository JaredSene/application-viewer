Hello,

Thanks for applying to start a Hack Club. (Because of these reasons) we've decided not to move forward with your club right now.
We deny applications, not people. We'd highly recommend that you take steps toward setting up your club like collecting signup or designing activities then we encourage you to apply again!

We’d love to answer any questions you have, just reply to this email.

Thank you for your interest!

— Holly @ Hack Club HQ
