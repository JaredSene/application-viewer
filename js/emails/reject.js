Hello,

Thanks for applying to start a Hack Club. After reviewing your application, we've decided not to move forward with your club.

It is important to note that we reject applications, not people. 
You are always welcome to submit another application. 
We highly recommend taking active steps toward setting up your club beforehand, such as collecting signups, running marketing campaigns, designing activities, or holding meetings.

If we can answer any questions about your application, feel free to reply to this email and we'll get back to you.

Thank you for your interest!

â€” Hack Club HQ
