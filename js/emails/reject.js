Hello,

Thanks for applying to start a Hack Club. (Because of these reasons) we've decided not to move forward with your club.
It is important to note that we reject applications, not people. We'd recommend you (do these things) then we encourage you to apply again!

We’d love to answer any questions you have, just reply to this email.

Thank you for your interest!

— Holly @ Hack Club HQ
