Welcome to Hack Club! We loved your application and we're so excited to welcome you into a community of teens like you. 
As a Hack Club Leader, you'll inspire others to make things they're proud of and you'll learn a lot yourself. We'll be here for you every step of the way!

There’s only 2 things left to do:

1. [Join us on Slack!](https://hackclub.com/slack/) 
If you’re not already on our Slack, you should _definitely_ be on our Slack. 
This is one of the best parts of being part of Hack Club! It’s **_the best_** place to:
    * Meet other teenagers like you
    * Get help if you’re stuck
    * Get invites to events
    * Get inspired 
    * Get involved in cool projects
    * Stay up-to-date on everything going on at Hack Club
    
2. Schedule a 30-minute Welcome Call with us! 
We’ll meet over Zoom to make sure you have everything you need to run an amazing club.

**Please respond to this email with three weekday times that work for you in the next week or 
so (include your time zone!) and I’ll be happy to schedule a meeting together.**

Can’t wait to meet, talk soon!

Best,

Holly @ Hack Club HQ`
