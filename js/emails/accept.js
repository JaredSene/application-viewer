`Hi ${names},


I just want to say that I really enjoyed reading your application, and I’m happy to share that we’re moving forward! Congratulations!

I’m Thomas from Hack Club HQ in Vermont, and I’ll be your point of contact at HQ.
Come to me for anything from marketing advice to thinking about starting a hackathon (like [Assemble](https://assemble.hackclub.com/), which was run by [
@sampoder
](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/USNPNJXNX), 17, from Singapore).

Let’s set up a call for us to meet over Zoom. We’ll get to know each other, I’ll set you up with all of the different Hack Club resources, and we’ll talk through the next steps for your club.

**Can you send me 3 times over the next week that work for a 45 minute Zoom call?** I’m online Monday - Friday, and available until 8 PM Eastern / 5 PM Pacific on Wednesday and Thursday, and until 4 PM Eastern / 1 PM Pacific Monday, Tuesday and Friday.

I’m so looking forward to getting to know you and supporting you as you embark on this journey.
Cheers!

Thomas
(p.s. I just put a package with stickers in the mail to you! DM me on Slack when you get it!)
