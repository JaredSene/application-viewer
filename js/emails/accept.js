First, I just want to say thank you - I really enjoyed reading the application you wrote about your Hack Club, and I’m happy to share that we’re moving forward! Congratulations!

To introduce myself, I’m Holly from Hack Club HQ in Vermont, and I’m going to be your point of contact at HQ. My job is to be here for you, where you can reach out to me for anything including over text or call (my number is 802-238-7261).

![Holly Waving](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&ik=839e921c5d&attid=0.1&permmsgid=msg-a:r6262172848995221536&th=182226f40497fca7&view=fimg&fur=ip&sz=s0-l75-ft&attbid=ANGjdJ8J_1u27RH8geIqCpM7Sk_mWfV6ep_IMfuSgcYkleiOsujRCLOcThh6jKPJZAajxNBiY3jgXhl82m81zhpnBfdiMPbfyDjYEX_F-3z-nGGMvr2b3gkuAHWUQCM&disp=emb&realattid=ii_l5vanevx0)

You can come to me for everything from marketing advice to thinking about starting a hackathon (like [Assemble](https://assemble.hackclub.com/), which was run by [@sampoder](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/USNPNJXNX), 17, from Singapore). My goal is to be your best friend inside of Hack Club, and to do everything I can to support you and your team.

As a next step, I’d like to set up a call for you and me to meet over Zoom. In this call, we'll get to know each other, I'll get you set up with all of the different Hack Club resources, and we'll talk through the next steps for your club.

**Can you send me 3 times over the next week that work for a 45 minute Zoom call?** I’m online Monday - Friday, and am typically available until 8 PM Eastern / 5 PM Pacific on Mondays and Tuesdays, and until 5 PM Eastern / 2 PM Pacific Wednesdays - Fridays.

One thing that’s important to note is that on the call, we’ll focus on how Hack Club can support you without telling you how to run your club. You know your high school better than anyone else in the world, and you’re going to know what’s going to work best. What would have worked great in [the high school I went to](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hodgdon+High+School/@46.0542533,-67.86672,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4ca4c2126935387f:0x77e39eaad04f0993!8m2!3d46.0542539!4d-67.864532) probably wouldn’t work at your school - and vice versa!

I'm so looking forward to getting to know you, and doing my best to support you as you embark on this journey.

Cheers!
Holly

(p.s. I just put a package with stickers in the mail to both of you, should arrive in 2-3 days! DM me on Slack when you get it!)

Best,
