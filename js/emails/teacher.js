Hello, 

Thank you for applying to Hack Club! 

Unfortunately, because we are a strictly student-led program we are unable to accept applications from teachers. 
If you have any motivated students who would be able to lead the club, we ask that you encourage them to submit an application.

Thank you for your interest! We look forward to hearing from your students.
