    Hey fools! We got a new application that just came in! _Wanna take charge of onboarding this A-Team???_ Check it out at ${this.url}.
    Their address is '_${this.location}_'
    That's it for now. Remember: _${this.t('application-committee.flavor')}_
bouncer-checkin:
  found: consider yourself present <@${this.user}>, now run along and join your team in <#${this.channel}>
  not-found: what kinda crazy mumbo-jumbo nonsense is this?? I could find a solid _nobody_ in our applications database with the registration passphrase "${this.pass}". try again, fool.
